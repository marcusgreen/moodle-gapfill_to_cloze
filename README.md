Gapfill to Cloze
Standard XML export except Gapfill questions get converted to the core Moodle Cloze type. Drag Drop and DropDown mode questions get converted to Cloze MC (dropdowns) and Gapfill to standard SA Cloze questions. Some Gapfill functionality will be lost but assuming basic usage they will be usable in any other Moodle without requiring installation of the Gapfill type.
